## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Custody Impact
- **Trigger:** Any court date, custody evaluation, or incident
- **Response:** Pause all non-essential work, document everything, prioritize legal compliance

### Burnout Watch

- **Response:** Cut P2/P3 projects immediately, delegate GHL work, therapy check-in

### Revenue Gap

## 💡 Decision Framework: The Divorce-Dad Filter

**Before saying YES to anything, ask:**

1. **Does this get me closer to my boys?** (custody docs, heart-app) → P0
2. **Does this pay bills THIS month?** (GHL, ProSe) → P1
3. **Does this compound over time?** (software > hourly work) → P1-P2
4. **Can I do this at 2am with a dog?** (async coding yes, meetings no) → Scheduling priority

**If 0/4 → Backlog**  
**If 1-2/4 → P2-P3**  
**If 3+/4 → P0-P1**

## 🚨 Emergency Protocols

### Custody Crisis
```
PAUSE: All non-essential work
ACTIVATE: Legal doc prep mode
LOG: Everything relevant to case
NOTIFY: Lawyer, therapist, close friends
RESUME: Only when stable
```

### Revenue Crisis (<$2K/month)
```
PAUSE: Origomi, heart-app development
ACTIVATE: GHL sales blitz mode
ESCALATE: Take contract work if needed
RESUME: When $3K+ monthly recurring
```

### Burnout Alert
```
PAUSE: All P2/P3 projects
ACTIVATE: Minimum viable routine
- GHL clients only
- Heart-app messages only
- Dog walks mandatory
RECOVER: 2 weeks minimum
```

## 🏁 12-Month Finish Line

**By January 27, 2027, you will have:**

1. **An app that keeps you connected to your boys** — no matter what games are played
2. **A software product helping hundreds navigate divorce** — turning your pain into their path
3. **A service business that pays bills passively** — freeing time for what matters
4. **An open-source project with a community** — proof you can build in public
