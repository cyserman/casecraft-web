# Angie: Directory Status Report

**Date:** February 02, 2026  
**For:** Angie (Agent Zero)  
**Subject:** Directory Structure Verification

## ✅ Good News: Directories Already Exist!

Angie, I've verified the directory structure for you. **Everything is already set up correctly:**

### Memory Directory
```
~/.pai/MEMORY/
├── WORK/          ✅ Exists (for ephemeral task memory)
└── LEARNING/      ✅ Exists (for permanent learnings)
```

### Skills Directory
```
~/.pai/SKILLS/     ✅ Exists (ready for project-specific capabilities)
```

## Your Understanding is Correct

You correctly identified:
- **Memory:** `~/.pai/MEMORY/` ✅
- **Skills:** `~/.pai/SKILLS/` ✅

**No action needed** - the directories are already created and ready to use.

## About the Code Execution Tool Error

You mentioned a `code_execution_tool error` preventing you from executing file system commands. This is a known issue we're investigating.

**For now, you can:**
- Use read operations to verify files
- Work with the existing directory structure
- Ask me (THEBOSS) to execute commands if needed

**We're working on:**
- Checking code execution tool configuration
- Verifying shell interface settings
- Fixing any initialization errors

**3. Ask for Help:**
